MVC
    Controller (Retrieve data and decide the response to the browser):
        Every public method in a controller is callable as an HTTP endpoint (Controller methods are referred to as action methods)
            Default URL routing logic /[Controller]/[ActionName]/[Parameters] in Program.cs
        Use HtmlEncoder.Default.Encode to protect the app from malicious input, such as through JavaScript.
        The model binding automatically assign the named parameters from the query string
        to parameters in the method.
    Views:( Should not   Do business logic    Interact with a database directly.) separation of concerns
        Uses Razor pages, you can use anchor Tag Helper attributes .
        Good practice: make folder to separate views.
        View _ViewStart.cshtml sets the layout for all views.
        You can pass data from the controller to the view:
            In a dictionary: ViewData["Key"] = "Value"  --ViewData is a dynamic object (any type can be used)
        In a view with model, the @model statement specifies the type of object that the view expects

        Partial Views:

    Models: Model names are singular because  represents a single data record
     A model is made up of entity classes and a context object that represents a session with the database
        Uses POCOs to define the properties of the data to be stored in the database
        Uses EFCore as ORM
        You can use DataAnnotations in model classes
        The context is derived from Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.DbContext and specifies the entities to include in the data model.

    You can install the next tools to scaffold and add SQLServer provider to the project
        Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design
        Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer
        Note: for VSCode see install_mvc_dependencies.sh

    Migrations:
    In package manager console PMC:
        Add-Migration InitialCreate
        Update-Database

    Customize model with DataAnnotations
    TableName

Notes:
 It is important to use redirect after mutating the database or application state.
 Otherwise, if the user refreshes the page, the browser will make the same request,
 and the mutation will be repeated.
