Fields denote storage locations, propierties has accessors (get set)

Guidelines https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/design-guidelines/
Accesibility:

    public: Access isn't limited.
    private: Access is limited to this class.
    protected: Access is limited to this class or classes derived from this class.
    internal: Access is limited to the current assembly (.exe or .dll).
    protected internal: Access is limited to this class, classes derived from this class, or classes within the same assembly.
    private protected: Access is limited to this class or classes derived from this type within the same assembly.

Operators: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/

String.Contains
String.ToUpper, ToLower, Replace
string.Empty; initialize a var with a empty string
Use tuple for swap values in array (array[i - 1], array[i]) = (array[i], array[i - 1])

Arrays,Collectinons use IEnumerable<T> interface
Hashtable: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/csharp/csharp_hashtable.htm

Delegates (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp/features#delegates-and-lambda-expressions)
https://code-maze.com/csharp-delegates/: 
    syntax delegate double Function(double x);
    C# has the two built-in delegates: Func<T> and Action<T>
    Func<T> Syntax: 
        Func<Type1, Type2..., ReturnType> DelegateName = new Func<Type1, Type2..., ReturnType>(MethodName); or
        Func< Type1, Type2..., ReturnType> name = MethodName;
    Action<T>
        Action<Type1, Type2...> DelegateName = new Action<Type1, Type2...>(MethodName);
        Action < Type1, Type2...> DelegateName = MethodName;

Variables
    static keyword are class variables or non-instance variable
    readonly keyword like instance variables but cannot be modified, 
            the value is assign in the constructor
    protected functions can be called only in derived classes

Program structure
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/program-structure/

Files and Registry (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/file-system/)
    File system information in following classes:
    System.IO.FileInfo, System.IO.DirectoryInfo, System.IO.DriveInfo, System.IO.Directory
    System.IO.File   
    Example : System.IO.DriveInfo di = new System.IO.DriveInfo(@"C:\");
    https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/file-system/how-to-get-information-about-files-folders-and-drives

   GetFiles , GetDirectories
        if any one of the subdirectories under the specified root causes a 
            DirectoryNotFoundException or UnauthorizedAccessException, the whole 
            method fails and returns no directories. 

    Traverse directory tree manually    
        pre-order traversal : files first
        post-order traversal : subdirectories first
        You can use recursion or stack-based traversal

        Recursion:
            Can cause a stack overflow exception if the dirtree is deeply nested and large
            Example: #recursive_traverse_directory_tree

        No recursion:
        Uses generic Stack<T> collection type wich is LIFO stack
        Example: #no_recursion_traverse_dirtree

        If you must store the contents of a directory tree, either in memory or 
        on disk, the best option is to store only the FullName property 
        (of type string) for each file. You can then use this string to create 
        a new FileInfo or DirectoryInfo object as necessary, or open any file 
        that requires additional processing.

        When you process user-specified path strings, you should also handle 
        exceptions for the following conditions:
            The file name is malformed. For example, it contains invalid characters 
                    or only white space.
            The file name is null.
            The file name is longer than the system-defined maximum length.
            The file name contains a colon (:).

Pattern Matching (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/functional/pattern-matching)
    Declarative pattern if(maybe is int number)
                            Console.WriteLine($"Maybe is int equal to {number}");
    switch expression
        Syntax: variable switch { expression => return_value,
                                    { } matches a non-null object that didnt match an earlier arm
                                    null matches null values}
        You must match all kind of expressiones, if not, compiler issues a warning

    Pattern matching makes some types of code more readable and offers an alternative to object-oriented techniques 
    when you can't add code to your classes. The cloud is causing data and functionality to live apart. 
    The shape of the data and the operations on it aren't necessarily described together. 
    In this tutorial, you consumed existing data in entirely different ways from its original function. 
    Pattern matching gave you the ability to write functionality that overrode those types, even though you couldn't extend them.

StreamReader and StreamWriter

Unit test 
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/testing/unit-testing-with-dotnet-test:
    dotnet new sln -o <carpeta_De_la_solucion>  Crear nueva solucion

    dotnet new classlib -o <carpeta_libreria_de_clases> 

    dotnet sln add <ruta-csproj> add the class library project to the solution.

    dotnet new xunit -o PrimeService.Tests  Create the test project

    dotnet sln add ./PrimeService.Tests/PrimeService.Tests.csproj   Add the test project to the solution file.

    dotnet add <carpeta-tests/csproj-file> reference <carpeta-source/csproj-file>  Add the PrimeService class library as a dependency to the PrimeService.Tests project.

    Name the test: public class ReferenceClass_thingToBeTested
    Use ARRANGE,ACTION,ASSERT
