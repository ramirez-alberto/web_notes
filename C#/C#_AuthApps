ASP.NET Core Identity is the membership system for web applications that includes membership, login and user data. ASP.NET Core Identity is a user store

### Implementation: 

**Packages**

* Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.EntityFrameworkCore

***Think about extending Identity schema***
Extend the User model from `IdentityUser`: if we want add additional data or use Claims ( populate the `Claim` object by providing the type and the value properties of the string type (`new Claim(string type, string value)`)

If its complex use custom properties otherwise use Claims


dotnet new webapp --auth Individual -o WebApp1

The preceding command creates a Razor web app using SQLite. To create the web app with LocalDB, run the following command: dotnet new webapp --auth Individual -uld -o WebApp1

The typical pattern is to call methods in the following order:

    Add{Service}
    builder.Services.Configure{Service}

Scaffold auth pages
Install-Package Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Design

A claim is a name value pair that represents what the subject is, not what the subject can do. 
An identity can contain multiple claims with multiple values and can contain multiple claims of the same type.
