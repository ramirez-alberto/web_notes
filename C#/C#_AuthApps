ASP.NET Core Identity is the membership system for web applications that includes membership, login and user data. ASP.NET Core Identity is a user store

dotnet new webapp --auth Individual -o WebApp1

The preceding command creates a Razor web app using SQLite. To create the web app with LocalDB, run the following command:
.NET CLI

dotnet new webapp --auth Individual -uld -o WebApp1

The typical pattern is to call methods in the following order:

    Add{Service}
    builder.Services.Configure{Service}

Scaffold auth pages
Install-Package Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Design

A claim is a name value pair that represents what the subject is, not what the subject can do. 
An identity can contain multiple claims with multiple values and can contain multiple claims of the same type.
