If you want to use a ServiceExtension class, the scope must be public and static 

WHen seeding data you can use configuration specific code for each model, implement IEntityTypeConfiguration and create a Configure method

MVC  -follows DRY principle (You can declaratively specify validation rules in one place (in the model class) and the rules are enforced everywhere in the app.)
    Controller (Retrieve data and decide the response to the browser):
        Every public method in a controller is callable as an HTTP endpoint (Controller methods are referred to as action methods)
            Default URL routing logic /[Controller]/[ActionName]/[Parameters] in Program.cs
        Use HtmlEncoder.Default.Encode to protect the app from malicious input, such as through JavaScript.
        The model binding automatically assign the named parameters from the query string
        to parameters in the method.
        Ideally, a controller should not directly access the context file. Instead, we should introduce a repository layer in between
    Views:( Should not   Do business logic    Interact with a database directly.) separation of concerns
        Uses Razor pages, you can use anchor Tag Helper attributes .
        Good practice: make folder to separate views.
        View _ViewStart.cshtml sets the layout for all views.
        You can pass data from the controller to the view:
            In a dictionary: ViewData["Key"] = "Value"  --ViewData is a dynamic object (any type can be used)
        In a view with model, the @model statement specifies the type of object that the view expects

        Partial Views: <partial name="_Authors" />

    Models: Model names are singular because  represents a single data record
     A model is made up of entity classes and a context object that represents a session with the database
        Uses POCOs to define the properties of the data to be stored in the database
        Uses EFCore as ORM
        You can use DataAnnotations in model classes
        The context is derived from Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.DbContext and specifies the entities to include in the data model.
        Customize model with DataAnnotations: TableName, StringLength , Required, Display, DataType, Range, Column, RegularExpression
            Value types (such as decimal, int, float, DateTime) are inherently required and don't need the [Required] attribute.
    Entity Framework assumes that primary key values are generated by the database.

    You can install the next tools to scaffold and add SQLServer provider to the project
        Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design
        Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer
        Note: for VSCode see install_mvc_dependencies.sh

    Migrations:
    In package manager console PMC:
        Add-Migration InitialCreate
        Update-Database

    Customize model with DataAnnotations
    TableName

    
Notes:
 It is important to use redirect after mutating the database or application state.
 Otherwise, if the user refreshes the page, the browser will make the same request,
 and the mutation will be repeated.

Concurrency conflicts>

        - You can keep track of property changes
        - You can let it happen ( a user overwrite data) Client Wins or Last in Wins scenario, this
            will happen automatically)
        - Prevent the last change from being updated in the db (Display a error message and the user
            need to reesubmit his request). This is called Store Wins scenario, data-store takes precedence
        (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/data/ef-mvc/concurrency?view=aspnetcore-6.0#optimistic-concurrency)

 Note:
    When the model class is different than the schema of the Movie table of the existing database. (There's no Rating column in the database table.)
    There are a few approaches to resolving the error:

    Have the Entity Framework automatically drop and re-create the database based on the new model class schema. This approach is very convenient early in the development cycle when you're doing active development on a test database; it allows you to quickly evolve the model and database schema together. The downside, though, is that you lose existing data in the database â€” so you don't want to use this approach on a production database! Using an initializer to automatically seed a database with test data is often a productive way to develop an application. This is a good approach for early development and when using SQLite.

    Explicitly modify the schema of the existing database so that it matches the model classes. The advantage of this approach is that you keep your data. You can make this change either manually or by creating a database change script.

    Use Code First Migrations to update the database schema.
                Add-Migration Rating
                Update-Database

    Bind attribute clears out any pre-existing data in fields not listed in the Include parameter.

Fetch Data:
    If related data is needed, FirstOrDefaultAsync is the choice, else, you can use FindAsync



Overposting
    You can prevent overposting in edit scenarios by reading the entity from the database first and then calling TryUpdateModel, passing in an explicit allowed properties list. That's the method used in these tutorials.

An alternative way to prevent overposting that's preferred by many developers is to use view models rather than entity classes with model binding. Include only the properties you want to update in the view model. Once the MVC model binder has finished, copy the view model properties to the entity instance, optionally using a tool such as AutoMapper. Use _context.Entry on the entity instance to set its state to Unchanged, and then set Property("PropertyName").IsModified to true on each entity property that's included in the view model. This method works in both edit and create scenarios.

Entity States:
    The database context keeps track of whether entities in memory are in sync with their corresponding rows in the database, and this information determines what happens when you call the SaveChanges method. For example, when you pass a new entity to the Add method, that entity's state is set to Added. Then when you call the SaveChanges method, the database context issues a SQL INSERT command.

    An entity may be in one of the following states:
        Added. The entity doesn't yet exist in the database. The SaveChanges method issues an INSERT statement.
        Unchanged. Nothing needs to be done with this entity by the SaveChanges method. When you read an entity from the database, the entity starts out with this status.
        Modified. Some or all of the entity's property values have been modified. The SaveChanges method issues an UPDATE statement.
        Deleted. The entity has been marked for deletion. The SaveChanges method issues a DELETE statement.
        Detached. The entity isn't being tracked by the database context.

    In a desktop application, state changes are typically set automatically. You read an entity and make changes to some of its property values. This causes its entity state to automatically be changed to Modified. Then when you call SaveChanges, the Entity Framework generates a SQL UPDATE statement that updates only the actual properties that you changed.
    In a web app, the DbContext that initially reads an entity and displays its data to be edited is disposed after a page is rendered. When the HttpPost Edit action method is called, a new web request is made and you have a new instance of the DbContext. If you re-read the entity in that new context, you simulate desktop processing.
    But if you don't want to do the extra read operation, you have to use the entity object created by the model binder. The simplest way to do this is to set the entity state to Modified as is done in the alternative HttpPost Edit code shown earlier. Then when you call SaveChanges, the Entity Framework updates all columns of the database row, because the context has no way to know which properties you changed.
    If you want to avoid the read-first approach, but you also want the SQL UPDATE statement to update only the fields that the user actually changed, the code is more complex. You have to save the original values in some way (such as by using hidden fields) so that they're available when the HttpPost Edit method is called. Then you can create a Student entity using the original values, call the Attach method with that original version of the entity, update the entity's values to the new values, and then call SaveChanges.

Foreign Key
The course entity has a foreign key property DepartmentID which points to the related Department entity and it has a Department navigation property.

The Entity Framework doesn't require you to add a foreign key property to your data model when you have a navigation property for a related entity. EF automatically creates foreign keys in the database wherever they're needed and creates shadow properties for them. But having the foreign key in the data model can make updates simpler and more efficient. For example, when you fetch a Course entity to edit, the Department entity is null if you don't load it, so when you update the Course entity, you would have to first fetch the Department entity. When the foreign key property DepartmentID is included in the data model, you don't need to fetch the Department entity before you update.

Cascade delete
By convention, the Entity Framework enables cascade delete for non-nullable foreign keys and for many-to-many relationships. This can result in circular cascade delete rules, which will cause an exception when you try to add a migration. For example, if you didn't define the Department.InstructorID property as nullable, EF would configure a cascade delete rule to delete the department when you delete the instructor, which isn't what you want to have happen. If your business rules required the InstructorID property to be non-nullable, you would have to use the following fluent API statement to disable cascade delete on the relationship:
C#

modelBuilder.Entity<Department>()
   .HasOne(d => d.Administrator)
   .WithMany()
   .OnDelete(DeleteBehavior.Restrict)
Join entities
It's common to name a join entity EntityName1EntityName2

A generic step-by-step overview of auth:

    Add a column to your Users table to contain the userâ€™s password_digest.
    When the user signs up, turn the password they submitted into digest form and then store THAT in the new database column by adding the has_secure_password method to your User model.
    Donâ€™t forget any necessary validations for password and password confirmation length.
    Build a sessions controller (and corresponding routes) and use the #authenticate method to sign in the user when the user has submitted the proper credentials using the signin form.
    Allow the user to be remembered by creating a remember_token column in the Users table and saving that token as a permanent cookie in the userâ€™s browser. Reset on each new signin.
    On each page load that requires authentication (and using a #before_action in the appropriate controller(s)), first check the userâ€™s cookie remember_token against the database to see if heâ€™s already signed in. If not, redirect to the signin page.
    Make helper methods as necessary to let you do things like easily determine if a user is signed in or compare another user to the currently signed in user.




    Transient objects are always different; a new instance is provided to every controller and every service.

    Scoped objects are the same within a request, but different across different requests.

    Singleton objects are the same for every object and every request.
