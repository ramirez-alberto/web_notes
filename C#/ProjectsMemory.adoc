HttpClient is intended to be instantiated once and reused throughout the life of an application.

== Manage HTTPClient lifetimes

The above still begs the question how you are going to manage HttpClient lifetimes:

* Singleton (app-scoped) HttpClients do not pick up DNS updates. 
    Your app will be ignorant of DNS updates unless you kill and restart it.

* A frequently-create-and-dispose pattern, using (HttpClient client = ) { }, can cause socket exhaustion.
