Axis
Main axis defined by flex-direction property and the cross axis runs perpendicular to it

Flex container is define by the display property "flex or inline-flex"

flex-flow combine the two properties flex-direction and flex-wrap

flex items

    flex-grow
    flex-shrink
    flex-basis
flex is the shortand
flex: 0 1 auto    //default values

flex-grow is 0, so items will not grow larger than their flex-basis size

align-items

The align-items property will align the items on the cross axis.

justify-content

The justify-content property is used to align the items on the main axis


    justify-content — controls alignment of all items on the main axis.
    align-items — controls alignment of all items on the cross axis.
    align-self — controls alignment of an individual flex item on the cross axis.
    align-content — described in the spec as for “packing flex lines”;
 controls space between flex lines on the cross axis.
    gap, column-gap, and row-gap — used to create gaps or gutters between flex items.

footer
make the card a flex container, with flex-direction: column.
 We then set the content area to flex: 1, 
which is the shorthand for flex: 1 1 0 — 
the item can grow and shrink from a flex basis of 0. 
As this is the only item that can grow, 
it takes up all available space in the flex container 
and pushes the footer to the bottom.
