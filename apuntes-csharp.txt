    private: Access is limited to this class.
    protected: Access is limited to this class or classes derived from this class.
    internal: Access is limited to the current assembly (.exe or .dll).
    protected internal: Access is limited to this class, classes derived from this class, or classes within the same assembly.
    private protected: Access is limited to this class or classes derived from this type within the same assembly.

    dotnet new sln -o <carpeta_De_la_solucion>  Crear nueva solucion

    dotnet new classlib -o <carpeta_libreria_de_clases> 

    dotnet sln add <ruta-csproj> add the class library project to the solution.

    dotnet new xunit -o PrimeService.Tests  Create the test project

    dotnet sln add ./PrimeService.Tests/PrimeService.Tests.csproj   Add the test project to the solution file.

    dotnet add <carpeta-tests/csproj-file> reference <carpeta-source/csproj-file>  Add the PrimeService class library as a dependency to the PrimeService.Tests project.

    Name the test: public class ReferenceClass_thingToBeTested
    Use ARRANGE,ACTION,ASSERT
