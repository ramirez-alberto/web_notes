method is a function part of a object.
Parameters are sometimes called arguments, properties, or even attributes.

    A parameter is the variable listed inside the parentheses in the function declaration (it’s a declaration time term)
    An argument is the value that is passed to the function when it is called (it’s a call time term).


Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations 
are moved to the top of their scope before code execution.
