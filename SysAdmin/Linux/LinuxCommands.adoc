== Saving Commands

You have many options for saving commands so you can remember them when you need them. Some options are:

* A Makefile per repo.
* An Ansible playbook. 
* `history | grep mycommand ` or ctrl+R 
* Set aliases for shorter commands or full scripts
* WebApps like https://cht.sh/[cht.sh] or https://tldr.sh/[tldr.sh] and https://github.com/dbrgn/tealdeer[tealdeer]

As a bonus, here's an ansible to log everyone's commands to syslog
