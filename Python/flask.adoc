== Blueprints

A *Blueprint* is a way to organize a group of related views and other code. You register blueprints with `app.register_blueprint(blueprint_var)` 

.Syntax
[source,python]
----
#name, Where it's defined, prepend predix in the uri
bp = Blueprint('auth', __name__, url_prefix='/auth') 

@bp.route("/")
def register();
    ...
----

You can use `@bp.before_app_request` registers a function that runs before the view function, no matter what URL is requested.

When using a blueprint, the name of the blueprint is prepended to the name of the function, so the endpoint for the login function you wrote above is 'auth.login'.

`g` is a special object that is unique for each request. It is used to store data that might be accessed by multiple functions during the request.
