== Blueprints

A *Blueprint* is a way to organize a group of related views and other code. You register blueprints with `app.register_blueprint(blueprint_var)` 

.Syntax
[source,python]
----
#name, Where it's defined, prepend predix in the uri
bp = Blueprint('auth', __name__, url_prefix='/auth') 

@bp.route("/")
def register();
    ...
----

You can use `@bp.before_app_request` registers a function that runs before the view function, no matter what URL is requested.

When using a blueprint, the name of the blueprint is prepended to the name of the function, so the endpoint for the login function you wrote above is 'auth.login'.

`app.add_url_rule()` associates the endpoint name 'index' with the / url so that url_for('index') or url_for('blog.index') will both work, generating the same / URL either way

`g` is a special object that is unique for each request. It is used to store data that might be accessed by multiple functions during the request. Is automatically available in templates

== Templates

Anything between *{{* and *}}* is an expression that will be output to the final document. *{%* and *%}* denotes a control flow statement like if and for.

Make a base layout, another views will extend this view. The base template is directly in the templates directory. To keep the others organized, the templates for a blueprint will be placed in a directory with the same name as the blueprint.

- Use `get_flashed_messages()` to get the `flash()` messages.

`loop.last` used to display a line after every row except the last row

== TESTS

https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/tutorial/tests/ WIP

== Deploying 

pip install wheel # current standard for distribution

python setup.py bdist_wheel #build a wheel distribution file

You can find the file in dist/flaskr-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl. The file name is in the format of {project name}-{version}-{python tag} -{abi tag}-{platform tag}. Install it with pip install

use a production WSGI server or a dedicated HTTP server in front of a WSGI server

=== Configure the Secret KeyÂ¶

python -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex())' Output random secret key 

Create a config.py in the instance folder with SECRET_KEY = key


== Flask API REST
__with sqlalchemy__

- *Dependencies*: flask, flask-sqlalchemy, flask-restful, flask-marshmallow

=== Introduction

1. Create the app
2. Import SQLAlchemy and pass the app to the SQLAlchemy object.
3. Create the model class, inherit from Model in the SQLAlchemy object.
4. Import Marshmallow and pass the app to the Marshmallow object.
5. Configure the schema with the  marshmallow class to expose data from the model to the user, inherti from Schema.
6. Initialize the schema (db), for simplicity, we can use the python interactive shell (REPL)

[source,python]
----
from app import db
db.create_all()
exit()
----

=== Create the RESTful endpoints with Flask-RESTful

. Import request from flask, and Api, Resource from flask-restful, create a object Api, pass app as an argument.
. Define a resource to accept GET requests: create a class and inherit from Resource, make a get method, this method
query the model and return a serialized object; register a resource with `api.add_resource`
. Add the post method, get the data from `request.json['value']` and use the model to create the data, add and commit
the contents of the session, dump the newly created data
. Define another resource to retrieve just one row from the db, inside this resource we will create the CRUD methods, for PUT use `request.json.get('value',default_value)` to update

== Flask Web App

- Dependencies: marshmallow-sqlalchemy, flask, flask, flask-sqlalchemy, flask-restful, flask-jwt-extended flask-cors

=== Steps

. Create an application factory
. Create the models as classes with `flask-sqlalchemy`, the classes inherit from `Model` and has properties that defines 
the column of the tables
. Create the relationships, one-to-one is defined as a column in the class, one-to-many uses the `relationship` method, 
and many-to-many uses a join-table: when you define the relation in both classes use the `secondary` argument with the name 
of the join-table in the `relationship` method to indicate a many-to-many relationship
. Create a schema as a class to Serialize and deserialize the objects in the db as JSON with `marshmallow-sqlalchemy`, 
the classes inherit from `SQLAlchemyAutoSchema` and has a nested class `Meta` with the folowing properties `model = Album`,
`include_relationships = True`, `load_instance = True`; Optionally, to make a custom serializer, create a class that inherit from `fields.Field` and has a method `def _serialize(self, value, attr, obj, **kwargs)`
. Create CRUD operations for the classes with `flask-restful`, define new classes for the views that inherits from `Resource` and
create the methods for the CRUD operations. Use `instance_of_schema.dumps()` to return data for this methods as JSON. 
. Test the app with POSTMAN.
. Add security with `flask-jwt-extended`, to do this you must pass `app` to a `JWTManager` in the app factory and set the variable `JWT_SECRET_KEY` in the `app.config`; define a login and sign-in views. Decorate a protected method with `jwt_required()`

==== FronEnd

. Install Flask-cors, Angular CLI and for vscode Angular Essentials, Angular Files
. Import CORS from flask-cors and pass the `app`
. Create a service to get the api address in Angular

==== Deploy

- Dependencies: gunicorn

For development set the environment variables FLASK_APP=app.py, FLASK_DEBUG=1, FLASK_ENV=development

Configure a app server with Gunicorn WSGI, work as a interface between python apps and a web server.
In a file wsgi.py add:

.wsgi.py
[source,python]
----
from app import app
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()
----

__Note: In Linux, allow the port 5000 with `sufo ufw allow 5000`__

Validate gunicorn executing `gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 wsgi:app`

Configure a reverse-proxy with Nginx, create a systemd file,this allow nginx to start automatically.
On Linux create a file with extension service: `sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/app.service`

Assign the group www-data, to allow nginx to communicate with the Gunicorn processes

Next, we need to configure the PATH variable so that the system knows where to 
find the executables, Systemd needs the Gunicorn executable path, in the same line add a worker if needed, create the Unix socket file `app.sock` in the project directory and bind to it and configure mask permission 007 to give the owner access when the file is created, specify the WSGI entry point filename `wsgi:app`.

Add the `[Install]` section , this will link the service to be loaded on the startup

[source]
----
[Unit]
Description=Gunicorn instance to serve APP
After=network.target

[Service]
User=your-localuser
Group=your-localuser
WorkingDirectory=/home/user/folder
Environment="PATH=/home/user/application-folder/bin/"
ExecStart=/home/user/application-folder/bin/gunicorn --workers 1 --bind unix:app.sock -m 007 wsgi:app

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
----

Activate the service with `sudo systemctl start app` and `sudo systemctl enable app`
Check the status with `sudo systemctl status app`

Now, install Nginx `sudo apt install nginx` and enable the listen port `sudo ufw allow 'Nginx HTTP'`
Create a config file `sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/app`

[source]
----
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name ip_servidor;

    location / {
        include proxy_params;
        proxy_pass http://unix:/home/user/application-folder/app.sock;
    }
}
----

Enable the config file `sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/app /etc/nginx/sites-enabled` and
check for syntax errors `sudo nginx -t`, if everything is ok, restart nginx `sudo systemctl restart nginx`

Enable full access to Nginx `sudo ufw allow 'Nginx Full'`
