== Blueprints

A *Blueprint* is a way to organize a group of related views and other code. You register blueprints with `app.register_blueprint(blueprint_var)` 

.Syntax
[source,python]
----
#name, Where it's defined, prepend predix in the uri
bp = Blueprint('auth', __name__, url_prefix='/auth') 

@bp.route("/")
def register();
    ...
----

You can use `@bp.before_app_request` registers a function that runs before the view function, no matter what URL is requested.

When using a blueprint, the name of the blueprint is prepended to the name of the function, so the endpoint for the login function you wrote above is 'auth.login'.

`app.add_url_rule()` associates the endpoint name 'index' with the / url so that url_for('index') or url_for('blog.index') will both work, generating the same / URL either way

`g` is a special object that is unique for each request. It is used to store data that might be accessed by multiple functions during the request. Is automatically available in templates

== Templates

Anything between *{{* and *}}* is an expression that will be output to the final document. *{%* and *%}* denotes a control flow statement like if and for.

Make a base layout, another views will extend this view. The base template is directly in the templates directory. To keep the others organized, the templates for a blueprint will be placed in a directory with the same name as the blueprint.

- Use `get_flashed_messages()` to get the `flash()` messages.

`loop.last` used to display a line after every row except the last row

== TESTS

== Deploying 

pip install wheel # current standard for distribution

python setup.py bdist_wheel #build a wheel distribution file

You can find the file in dist/flaskr-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl. The file name is in the format of {project name}-{version}-{python tag} -{abi tag}-{platform tag}. Install it with pip install

use a production WSGI server or a dedicated HTTP server in front of a WSGI server

=== Configure the Secret KeyÂ¶

python -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex())' Output random secret key 

Create a config.py in the instance folder with SECRET_KEY = key


== Flask API REST
__with sqlalchemy__

- *Dependencies*: flask, flask-sqlalchemy, flask-restful, flask-marshmallow

=== Introduction

1. Create the app
2. Import SQLAlchemy and pass the app to the SQLAlchemy object.
3. Create the model class, inherit from Model in the SQLAlchemy object.
4. Import Marshmallow and pass the app to the Marshmallow object.
5. Configure the schema with the  marshmallow class to expose data from the model to the user, inherti from Schema.
6. Initialize the schema (db), for simplicity, we can use the python interactive shell (REPL)

[source,python]
----
from app import db
db.create_all()
exit()
----

=== Create the RESTful endpoints with Flask-RESTful

. Import request from flask, and Api, Resource from flask-restful, create a object Api, pass app as an argument.
. Define a resource to accept GET requests: create a class and inherit from Resource, make a get method, this method
query the model and return a serialized object; register a resource with `api.add_resource`
. Add the post method, get the data from `request.json['value']` and use the model to create the data, add and commit
the contents of the session, dump the newly created data
. Define another resource to retrieve just one row from the db, inside this resource we will create the CRUD methods, for PUT use `request.json.get('value',default_value)` to update

== Flask Web App

- Dependencies: marshmallow-sqlalchemy, flask, flask, flask-sqlalchemy, flask-restful

=== Steps

. Create an application factory
. Create the models as classes with `flask-sqlalchemy`, the classes inherit from `Model` and has properties that defines 
the column of the tables
. Create the relationships, one-to-one is defined as a column in the class, one-to-many uses the `relationship` method, 
and many-to-many uses a join-table: when you define the relation in both classes use the `secondary` argument with the name 
of the join-table in the `relationship` method to indicate a many-to-many relationship
. Create a schema as a class to Serialize and deserialize the objects in the db as JSON with `marshmallow-sqlalchemy`, 
the classes inherit from `SQLAlchemyAutoSchema` and has a nested class `Meta` with the folowing properties `model = Album`,
`include_relationships = True`, `load_instance = True`; Optionally, to make a custom serializer, create a class that inherit from `fields.Field` and has a method `def _serialize(self, value, attr, obj, **kwargs)`
. Create CRUD operations for the classes with `flask-restful`, define new classes for the views that inherits from `Resource` and
create the methods for the CRUD operations. Use `instance_of_schema.dumps()` to return data for this methods as JSON.
