Declare variable:
    Use let and const instead of var.
    camelCase
    Cannot use reserved words

    Constant
    use constants as aliases for difficult-to-remember values.
     Example: const COLOR_RED = "#F00";
     Note:  capital-named constants are only used as aliases for “hard-coded” values.

There are 8 basic data types in JavaScript (Seven are called primitives).

    number for numbers of any kind: integer or floating-point, integers are limited by ±(253-1).
    bigint is for integer numbers of arbitrary length.
    string for strings. A string may have zero or more characters, there’s no separate single-character type.
    boolean for true/false.
    null for unknown values – a standalone type that has a single value null.
    undefined for unassigned values – a standalone type that has a single value undefined.
    object for more complex data structures.
    symbol for unique identifiers.

Numbers (Number object):
    JavaScript Numbers are Always 64-bit Floating Point and are always stored as 
     double precision floating point numbers, following the international IEEE 754 standard. 
     This format stores numbers in 64 bits, where the number (the fraction) is stored in bits 0 to 51,
     the exponent in bits 52 to 62, and the sign in bit 63

    Large or extra small number can be written with scientific notation:
     let x = 123e5;    // 12300000
     let y = 123e-5;   // 0.00123 

    Precision:
    Integer are accurate up to 15 digits and the max number of decimals ia 17
    Floating point arithmetic is not always 100% accurate

    The + operand is for sum number or concatenate strings
    NaN = Not a Number  but typeof Nan = number
    Infinity keyword represent a number outside the largest possible number
    Can use toString(base) to outuput numbers from base 2 to base 36 

    Operator precedence:
    https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#operator_precedence

Strings:
    Escape quotes with backslash \
    With Template literals ` you can concatenate variables ans strings `Hello ${variable}` or use the * operand. And template literal respect the line 
    breaks. 

Comparisons: if(comparison) action;
    Prioritize the use of strict equality ===
    String comparison - strings are compared letter-by-letter (lexicographical order)
    JS transform values to number for comparison, comparison convert null to 0 and the equality dont convert.

Logical Operators: OR || , AND && , NOT ! , ?? NULLISH COALESCING

OR
For each operand, converts it to boolean. If the result is true, stops and returns the original value of that operand.
If all operands have been evaluated (i.e. all were false), returns the last operand.
Uses:
    Getting the first truthy value from a list of variables or expressions. firstName || lastName || nickName || "Anonymous" returns Anonymous if false, or the data if true
    Short-circuit evaluation It means that || processes its arguments until the first truthy value is reached, and then the value is returned immediately, without even touching the other argument.
    Sometimes, people use this feature to execute commands only if the condition on the left part is falsy.
    true || alert("not printed");
false || alert("printed");

AND
    The rules above are similar to OR. The difference is that AND returns the first falsy value 
    while OR returns the first truthy one.


Precedence of AND && is higher than OR || and ! is the highest

!!value convert value to true or false. Boolean(value) is the same

Switch....case
switch(expression){
    case choice:
    something
    break;
    default:
}

Ternary operator
    ( condition ) ? run this code : run this code instead

Arrays:
    let array = [1,2,3] or let array = [] or let array = new Array(1,2,3,4)
    Arrays can store any type of value.
    Associative array or hashes is arrays with named indexes, JS interpret them as objects

js and html

const html = document.querySelector('type selector');
other_html.addEventListener('event', function or  () => ternary operator);

DOM (Document Object Model):
    <node></node>
    Select first child - firstElementChild
    Select last child - firstElementChild

    Put the script node in the botton or add to the head node and include the defer
    keyword <script src="js-file.js" defer></script> when DOM manipulation

Events:
    Note: can only have 1 onclick property
    inline event attributes like onclick => <button onclick="alert('Hello World')">Click Me</button>
    assign event to the button =>
        const btn = document.querySelector('#btn');
        btn.onclick = () => alert("Hello World");
    
    Multiple onclik or events if necessary
        const btn = document.querySelector('#btn');
        btn.addEventListener('click', () => {
        alert("Hello World");
        });

    Useful events https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_event.asp
    click
    dblclick
    keypress
    keydown
    keyup

Objects: object literal
    {key called property :value}
    Empty object   
        let user = new Object(); // "object constructor" syntax
        let user = {};  // "object literal" syntax
    Properties
        delete user.age remove a property
        object.new_property = value add property
        multiword property must be quoted {"property name" : value}
        The last property in the list may end with a comma (trailing comma)
        acces properties(  prefered var[key])
        Properties always string or converted to string
        Reading a non-existing property just returns undefined. We can check if properties exists with in operator
            "key" in object property always in string, you can use a strong variable( var in object)
        Computed Properties:
            var = value
            object = { [var] : otherValue,} here var is replaced for value (Computed property) 
            object.value = otherValue  

        for in loop access properties for(let key in object){}
        “integer property” term here means a string that can be converted to-and-from an integer without a change.
        Propertie value shorthand:
                function makeUser(name, age) {
                    return {
                        name: name,
                        age: age,
                        // ...other properties
                    };
                }

                let user = makeUser("John", 30);
                alert(user.name); // John

            is tha same as:

                function makeUser(name, age) {
                return {
                    name, // same as name: name
                    age,  // same as age: age
                    // ...
                };
                }
        Function property:
            {
                key : function(){return true},
            }
            or
            {
                key() {return true},
            }            

    this keyword refer to the var in the context of the object this.key
        Contructor:
        First method (not a constructor same funcionality) : we have to create an empty object, initialize it, and return it.
        function createPerson(name) {
            const obj = {};
            obj.name = name;
            obj.introduceSelf = function() {
            console.log(`Hi! I'm ${this.name}.`);
            }
        return obj;
        }
        Second method (constructor):        
            create a new object
            bind this to the new object, so you can refer to this in your constructor code
            run the code in the constructor
            return the new object.
        Constructors, by convention, start with a capital letter and are named for the type of object they create
            function Person(name) {
            this.name = name;
            this.introduceSelf = function() {
                console.log(`Hi! I'm ${this.name}.`);
            }
            }
        and for call the constructor const var = new Person('value')
