    Scan images in IBM Container Registry and push to internal OpenShift Registry for less latency:
        -Create an image stream that points to your image in IBM Cloud Container Registry
        oc tag us.icr.io/$MY_NAMESPACE/guestbook:v1 guestbook:v1 --reference-policy=local --scheduled
                    -copy to local cache of internal registry as a image stream, periodic importing of the image
        oc import-image guestbook:v1 --from=us.icr.io/$MY_NAMESPACE/guestbook:v1 --confirm
            -Import a new image
