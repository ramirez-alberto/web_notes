== Transactions

Transactions are an unit of work, consisting of one or more SQL statements. 

In development there are ACID transactions:

- *Atomic* - All changes must be performed successfully or not at all.
- *Consistent* - Data must be in a consistent state before and after the transaction.
- *Isolated* - No other process can change the data while the transaction is running.
- *Durable* - The changes made by the transaction must persist.
