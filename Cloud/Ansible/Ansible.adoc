=== Ansible playbook

Its a YAML file which contains Plays, Modules and Plugins.

.Plays
Will tell which hosts it will execute on and control behavior such as privilege level. These are the building blocks of an Ansible playbook and can have multiple plays.

- name: install and start apache
  hosts: web
  become: yes

.Modules
Components with a internal logic, represent a single step to be done. These are the tools.
Modules are written in python, in the example below `template` is a module.

- name: latest index.html file
  template: 
    src: files/index.html
    dest: /var/html/www

.Plugins
Ansible uses a plugin architecture to enable a rich, flexible and expandable feature set.
In a early example, `become` is a plugin for privilege scalation.
