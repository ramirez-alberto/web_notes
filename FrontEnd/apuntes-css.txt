*Box model
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model

margin collapses between 2 elements next to each other, chooses the largest
box-sizing border-box

change outer display type of a box between flex,inline,grid,block with display property.

If a box has an outer display type of block, it will behave in the following ways:

    The box will break onto a new line.
    The box will extend in the inline direction to fill the space available in its container. In most cases this means that the box will become as wide as its container, filling up 100% of the space available.
    The width and height properties are respected.
    Padding, margin and border will cause other elements to be pushed away from the box

Some HTML elements, such as <h1> and <p>, use block as their outer display type by default.

If a box has an outer display type of inline, then:

    The box will not break onto a new line.
    The width and height properties will not apply.
    Vertical padding, margins, and borders will apply but will not cause other inline boxes to move away from the box.
    Horizontal padding, margins, and borders will apply and will cause other inline boxes to move away from the box.

Some HTML elements, such as <a>, <span>, <em> and <strong> use inline as their outer display type by default.

The type of box applied to an element is defined by display property values such as block and inline, and relates to the outer value of display.
